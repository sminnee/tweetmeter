TweetMeter is a simple web-app that will generate a graph of daily tweet counts
for a number of keywords.

It's not currently hosted anywhere; I'm just running on my local MAMP install.

It should be pretty easy to deploy onto any PHP web host, but note that:

 * PHP will need CURL running.
 * PHP needs to be able to write to /tmp
